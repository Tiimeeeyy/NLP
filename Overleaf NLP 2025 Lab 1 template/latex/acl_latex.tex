\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
DELETE (OR REPLACE) AFTER YOU READ. This is a template for the report of the NLP 2025 labs. It is adapted from the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference\footnote{\url{https://aclrollingreview.org/authors}}. Fill in your names in the authors list and provide your answers to the exercises listed in the accompanying notebook. The answer to each exercise should be in a separate section. For the coding exercises, provide code snipped and a short explanation. For the open questions, you can add figures, plots, tables, etc. Make sure to include a short discussion.

You need to submit a PDF of your report (use the templates provided in latex (preferred) or word and a copy of your notebook with the code. Make sure that all figures/results/plots are shown in your (execucted) notebook. While you may talk with others about this lab, we ask that you write your solutions with your group only. If you do discuss specific tasks with others please include their names in the appendix. Honor code applies to this lab. For more check Syllabus ยง7.2. It is mandatory to list and disclose any website (or other resource) you used (e.g. stackoverflow) as well as any genAI tools (e.g. chatGPT) used. Failure to disclose these is a violation of academic integrity. For more check Syllabus ยง7.3. THIS TEXT WILL BE SELF-DESTROYED AFTER YOU READ IT.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Uesful \LaTeX{} commands}
In this short section we will show you several commands that you can adapt when writing your answers. Feel free to remove this section before submitting your report.

To write a short in-line code snippet you can use the following command \verb|print('Hello World')|. For longer pieces of code use the following:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
def foo():
    print('Hello World')
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Here is the example of a table. Each table and figure should have a reference from text. You can set the label in the table and use \verb|\ref{tab:citations}| command to reference it. For example, Table~\ref{tab:citations} presents different ways to cite a bibliography. In the report, you can add references but it is not required.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \hline
    \textbf{Output}           & \textbf{natbib command} \\
    \hline
    \citep{Gusfield:97}       & \verb|\citep|           \\
    \citet{Gusfield:97}       & \verb|\citet|           \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{citation-guide}
    Citation commands supported by the style file.
    The style is based on the natbib package and supports all natbib citation commands.
  }
  \label{tab:citations}
\end{table}

Figures can be added by first uploading the image file to overleaf and then using the following command (and reference it using Figure~\ref{fig:zipf}):
\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{zipf.png}
  \caption{This is a caption of the figure.}
  \label{fig:zipf}
\end{figure}

\section{Exercise 1: Questions about the datasets}

Your answers here.

% \subsection{What is the size of the training, test and validation datasets?}

% Your answer here

% \subsection{What are the top 5 most frequent emojis in the validation dataset?}

% \subsection{Compare the distributions of labels (emojis) between training and validation datasets.}

% \subsection{How many examples with the "fire" emoji are in the training dataset?}

% \subsection{What is the average length (in characters) of the tweets in the training dataset?}

\section{Exercise 2: Write the text cleaning function}

\section{Use of genAI}

Use of genAI tools (e.g. chatGPT), websites (e.g. stackoverflow): list websites where you found code (or other info) as well as include information on how you used genAI tools (e.g. prompts).  Failure to disclose use of genAI tools is violation of adademic integrity.
