    "During the first few weeks, we discussed various ways to represent text 📝. One key question was: What should be the basic unit of representation? Words are the fundamental building blocks 🧱.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",

    "These numerical representations (or weights) are learned using machine learning models 🤖. We’ll dive deeper into how these vectors are learned in the next lecture 📚.\n",

The bag-of-words representation is a simple and effective way to represent text data. It involves creating a vocabulary of unique words from the dataset and representing each sentence as a vector of word counts. We first need the vocabulary, which we will build from both the full sentences and the compressed sentences. Similar to the first lab, the vocabulary will be a list of unique words from the dataset."

    "`vocab_size` is calculated as the length of the passed `token_to_id` dictionary. The resulting array should have zeros everywhere but the indices corresponding to the words in the vocabulary where it should have the counts of the words in the sentence. For example, if the sentence is `['fox', 'and', 'deer']` and the vocabulary is `{'fox': 0, 'and': 1, 'deer': 2}`, the resulting array should be `[1, 1, 1]`. If the sentence is `['fox', 'and', 'fox', 'deer']`, the resulting array should be `[2, 1, 1]`."

    "## 5. Sentence Embeddings by Averaging Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a powerful model for representing words and their meaning (in terms of distributional similarity). As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course, we will see different architectures that take into account the sequence of words (by combining their vectors). A first naive but simple and sometimes (as we are going to see) quite effective approach would be to represent a sentence with an embedding vector that is the average of the word vectors that form the sentence.\n",
